# SmarTablero
Un tablero where I display "information" I care about but I am too lazy to look it up, like weather for example.

## TODO:
### Frontend
- Prettify, also for simplicity define screen size (?)
- When it's night show next day concatenated with current one

### Backend
- Get data from concerts, events in Barcelona
- Get data from news
#### Weather
- Get `estadoCielo`
- Get information about amanecer (`orto`) and atardecer (`ocaso`)
- Get informacio diaria for the coming days, if it's from a different API call (e.g., looking ahead of 4 days)
