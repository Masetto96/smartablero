# SmarTablero
Un tablero where I display "information" I care about but I am too lazy to look it up, like weather, events, maybe news?

## TODOs
### Frontend
- Rain mm is currently an int and shall be converted to float, it's causing the chart to wrongly display ðŸ˜ž
- Prettify ALL

#### Weather - ideas
- Get `estadoCielo`
- Get information about amanecer (`orto`) and atardecer (`ocaso`)
- Get info about huimidty
- Get informacio diaria, it's from a different API call of AEMET its forecasting more days ahead

# Resources
- Weather API [AEMET Open Data](https://opendata.aemet.es/centrodedescargas/inicio)
